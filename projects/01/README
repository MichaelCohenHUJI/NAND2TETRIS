README - This file.
And.hdl - return 'logic and' of two currents.
And16.hdl - returns the 'logic and' of 16 pairs of currents.
DMux.hdl - returns two current. the first will equal to the in current in case
 sel equal zero, otherwise the second.
DMux4Way.hdl - same as above but distributing for 4 currents.
DMux8Way.hdl - same as above but distributing for 8 currents.
Mux.hdl - returns the first current if the third is positive. otherwise
 the seconed current.
Mux16.hdl - returns the first group of the 16 currents if the third is positive
 otherwise returns the second group.
Mux4Way16.hdl - returns the current which 'sel' is the binary representation of.
Mux8Way16.hdl - the same as above, but selecting from 8 currents.
Not.hdl - returns the opposite current.
Not16.hdl - returns the 'opposite' for each from the 16 input currents.
Or.hdl - return 'logic or' of two currents.
Or16.hdl - returns the 'logic or' of 16 pairs of currents.
Or8Way.hdl - returns positive current if one of the 8 input current is positive.
Xor.hdl -returns the 'xor operation' of two currents.

Remarks
-------
we don't made something sophisticated that worth an explanation.
